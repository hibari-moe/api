\section{Web Service Proposal}

Kitsu\footnote{https://kitsu.io}, an anime \& manga discovery and tracking service (similar to IMDb), is the web service I will be consuming for this project. It exposes a RESTful API\footnote{https://kitsu.docs.apiary.io} using the JSON:API\footnote{http://jsonapi.org} specification.

The web service I aim to implement should collect user's public library data and output various statistics based on what the user has seen, liked or hated per each category - e.g the average rating a user has given shows in a specific category. For example, user A rated shows in the Comedy category 6.84 out of 10 on average.

\texttt{10 marks}
