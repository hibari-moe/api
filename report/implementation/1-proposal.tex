\subsection{External Web Services}

Kitsu, an anime \& manga discovery and tracking service (similiar to IMDb): \url{https://kitsu.io}. It exposes a RESTful API (\url{https://kitsu.docs.apiary.io}) using the JSON:API\footnote{\url{http://jsonapi.org}} specification.

\subsection{Proposed Data Consumption}

The web service I aim to implement should collect user's public library data on request and should process output various statistics based on what the user has seen, liked or hated per each category - e.g the average rating a user has given shows in a specific category. For example, user A rated shows in the Comedy category 6.84 out of 10 on average.
