\section{Project Name}

Hibari API

\section{Overview of the Project}

The project will provide extra statistics related to users and media on Kitsu, which would require hundreds of requests to generate client-side. The provided statistics from this project can then be used to provide users insights into what they are watching/reading and how they compare to other users on the service.

\section{External Web Services to Be Consumed}

The Web Service I will be consuming in this project is Kitsu\footnote{\url{https://kitsu.io}}, an anime \& manga discovery and tracking service (similar to IMDb). Its Web Service published as a RESTful API\footnote{\url{https://kitsu.docs.apiary.io}} that uses the JSON:API\footnote{\url{http://jsonapi.org}} specification.

\section{What Will Be Exposed in My Web Service}
\fxwarning{In progress}

\textbf{Note:} \textit{media} refers to \textit{anime} and \textit{manga} exposed as separate API methods that share the same functionality.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Computed statistics of media ratings
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Count
      \item Mean
      \item Median
      \item Mode
      \item Variance
      \item Standard deviation
      \item Raw rating frequency (key-value pair of \texttt{rating: occurance}
      \fxnote{Maybe also Chebyshev's Theorem and Coefficient of Variation}
    \end{enumerate}
  \item User libraries
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Computed statistics of media in the user's library (see above)
      \item Computed statistics of media in the user's library filtered by category (see above)
      \item Top 10 media per category
      \item Total episodes/chapters seen
      \item Total episodes/chapters seen per status type (Currently Watching, Plan to Watch, Completed, On Hold and Dropped)
      \item Total episodes/chapters not seen
      \item Total episodes/chapters not seen per status type
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Categories
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Computed statistics of media in a category (see above)
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Media
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Rank in category (position and percentile)
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
